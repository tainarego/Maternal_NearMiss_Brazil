# Maternal_NearMiss_Brazil
Maternal Near miss data was acquired by the Department of Informatics of Unified Health System (DATASUS). The identification of maternal near miss cases in Brazil over the years was made by Python language and PySUS library. The resulting sample passed by filters of sex, age, admission of hospitalization record (AIH), pre-natal record, and maternal near miss classifications criterion (Waterstone et al., 2002; Mantel et al., 1998; Say et al., 2009).
The Jupyter Notebooks were made available for the process of acquisition and manipulation of the data.
